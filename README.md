This repository contains various popular Quantum Algorithms which are used for benchmarking the performance of **Local & Cloud Simulators** and **QPUs**. We have used Algorithmic implementations and implementation of Volumetric plots from [Application-Oriented Performance Benchmarks for Quantum Computing](https://github.com/SRI-International/QC-App-Oriented-Benchmarks) repository which is maintained by members of the Quantum Economic Development Consortium (QED-C) Technical Advisory Committee on Standards and Performance Metrics (Standards TAC).

The **CPU** directory will have all the CPU based benchmarks performed using native simulators.

**CLOUD** based simulations are still in **WIP**.
